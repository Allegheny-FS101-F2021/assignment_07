### Instructions
This assignment requires you to locate three articles which are relevant to your essay from Assignment 05. You are to read these articles and to provide *summaries* of no more than 100 words. Remember, you are to capture the relevant points of the article, not to rephrase it. Please angle your thinking in general to the feedback that you received from your instructor. This feedback can be found in your gradebook repository. You will later use these references (along with the one from the previous assignment) to add support and grounding to your previous essay.


### References
To locate this article, you are to use an online search engine such as [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) for a keyword which is highly relevant to your subject area. Keep the reference!

## GitHub and Markdown

 - First, please familiarize yourself with GitHub. For example, [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) provides a good reference guide. If you require more help, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
