Article 1
Raivo Sell, Mairo Leier, Anton Rassõlkin, Juhan-Peep Ernits, “Self-driving car ISEAUTO for 	research and education”, Research and Education in Mechatronics (REM) 2018 19th 	International Conference on, pp. 111-116, 2018.
This source talks about self-driving cars all over the world and their development. China, Japan, and Korea are all making various implications of adopting autonomous vehicles in their societies. Countries like India with high accident rates are hesitant to adopt the technology due to their high accident rate. In the United States social media is helping to push the idea of autonomous vehicles out to the public. However, in all of these countries mentioned various government policies and legal restrictions are holding the autonomous vehicles back from being mass produced and sent out.

Article 2

This article talks about the International Conference on Machine Learning and how attacks on artificial intelligence are too likely to occur with the current state of alternate intelligence. A stop sign was manipulated by placing a sticker on it, which misled the image recognition alternative intelligence system into thinking it was a 45 mile per hour speed limit sign. This test was done to shown how dangerous self-driving cars would be at the moment due to lack of necessary development of the image recognition system.

Article 3
Kohl, Christopher, et al. “Anticipating Acceptance of Emerging Technologies Using Twitter: The Case of Self-Driving Cars.” Journal of Business Economics, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 8 Mar. 2018, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11573-018-0897-5. 
This article highlights the early stage of developing technologies while there is great uncertainty regarding their future success, as it pertains to autonomous vehicles. The article talks about how these companies need to listen to their customers uncertainties to help increase public support for autonomous vehicles. Right now, safety is the main and only concern regarding autonomous vehicles due to their high risk of AI malfunction. This is extremely dangerous and until the customers feel safe in the vehicles, they will not be bought at the rate that the producing companies would want.
